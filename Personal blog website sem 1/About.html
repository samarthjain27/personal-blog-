            <h1>Trip To Goa</h1>
            <p>My trip to goa was full of enjoyment and adventures . It was a five day trip from 22nd  November to 27th november . On 22nd  morning me and my family reached Goa and got welcomed by the cool breeze . After reaching the goa airport we went to our selected beachside resort .

            In the afternoon we spent time at our resort relaxing by the pool . In the evening we headed towards the nearby beach shack to enjoy some local goan cuisines . don't forget to try dishes like poi bread , goan bun , and also their famous kaju feni .
