            Friends can help you celebrate good times and provide support during bad times. friendship is shared by some people who have similar interests and feelings. You meet many along the way of life but only some stay with you forever.
            <br>
            
            Friendship is important because it helps us build connections with people who share our values or interests. Friendship in simple words is a relationship you have with your chosen family .
                <br>
            As I said, I had a group  of  8 friends including me .  When we were together we enjoyed our lives at our fullest . But now we all are in different cities busy with our own lives . I miss those days when we were together. It's been almost four years to this group.
                <br>


            When we all meet either we play basketball or we go for long drives . We enjoy each other's company . We all have a very strong bond together . everything we do , we do it together .

                <br>
            Our parents also know each other very well . When we are together I guarantee no one can compete with us .
                <br>
            On each and every festival we go to each other's house to meet their parents and after that we altogether go out and have fun together .

            Once we all planned a barbecue night at my home’s terrace . It was a great night for all of us. We enjoyed it a lot , we had fun , we played games , we enjoyed the food . That night was the night I will never forget .
                
                <br>
                
            Also once we planned a trip to the famous lord shiva temple near our hometown . We all respect each other's interests and coordinate with each other .
                
                <br>
                
            Friends are that part of your life which you will never forget . If you have good friends you can deal with any of the worst case scenarios in your life .
                <br>
                
            There is a relation, which we choose ourselves. That relation is a friend.   Friends make our life beautiful.
                <br>
            The adventure of life becomes beautiful when good friends are there in our lives .
            <br>
           
           My friends have supported me in each and every difficult phase of my life . They were always by my side . Friendship is the purest form of relation , There should be loyalty and honesty in friendship then only it will last long forever .

                <br>

            Friendship is something without which we feel very lonely in our life . If friends are not there in life we feel demotivated but if we have friends they are always there to support us and cheer us .

                <br>

            We should always make good friends , Because if good friendship has positive effects then bad friendship has negative effects also . one can spoil his/her career due to wrong friendship .

            <h2>Challenges</h2>

            <p>
            In my life, I have encountered a series of challenges that have tested my patience and contributed to my personal growth.
            <br>    
            Academic challenges, such as difficult subjects and demanding coursework, have frequently pushed me out of my comfort zone.
            <br>
            Additionally, there were moments when I struggled with time management and maintaining a healthy study-life balance. I learned to overcome shyness, enhance my communication skills, and cultivate lasting friendships.
                <br>
 

            These experiences have not only shaped me academically but have also equipped me with valuable life skills for the future.
                <br>
            Learning to balance between academic and personal life was a constant struggle, with many sleepless nights and moments of self-doubt.

                <br>

            In addition to the academic trials, I faced social and personal challenges. They taught me the importance of adaptability, and the ability to learn from failures.
            <br>
            
            They have not only made me a more strong  student but have also provided me with invaluable life skills that extend far beyond the classroom.
                <br>

            The journey as a student is filled  with obstacles, but it is through these trials that I have grown, developed, and emerged as a more capable and confident individual, ready to face the future with determination and strength.

                <br>

            Academic challenges have been a consistent presence throughout my student life.I learned to organise my study schedules efficiently, prioritise tasks, and adapt my learning techniques to be more effective.

            <h2>My Experience After Coming To Bangalore</h2>
            <p>When i came to bangalore i was a bit nervous in the starting because i was totally new in bangalore . Also as a student i had to find a hostel also and the college visit and many more things were there in my mind .
                <br>

            Also i was not having any friends here in Bangalore . I was all alone before the  college started .
                 <br>
                
            As days passed I became familiar with the city and I was feeling confident .Bangalore is known as the "Silicon Valley of India"
            <br>
            
            The climate is one of the best aspects of Bangalore. Since it is at an elevation of 920m the weather is pleasant throughout the year, even during the summer months.
                <br>


            Bangalore has a very competitive cost of living in comparison to other  metro cities in India. As a student it's a little tough for me because everything here in bangalore is very costly .
                <br>


            Being a student in Bangalore you have to deal with  so many things like hostel / Pg rent , travel expenses , and also food is a major problem in the hostels and pg’s .
            <br>
            
            When I came to Bangalore I was so stressed , I was missing my family, my hometown and my friends .  There was a time when I was ready to go  back leaving everything .
                <br>

            But then my Elder brother encouraged me with his valuable words and gave me the strength to fight with my fears and insecurities .
                <br>

            As the time passed I started getting comfortable with the city and no more doubts were there in my mind .
                <br>

            My college is almost nine kilometres  from where i live.daily travelling nine kilometres and back is such a struggle right now as I have to travel.
