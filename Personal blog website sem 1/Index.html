            <h1>About Myself</h1>
            <p>My name is Samarth jain . I am from Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh. I completed my Schooling till 12th in Khandwa itself. The name of my school is St. Joseph's convent senior secondary school. I belong to a commerce background. After completing 12th i moved to bangalore for my further studies .Here I have opted for a bachelor's in ui design and development (uiux) . The name of my college is Icat design and media college Bangalore. I have a very friendly nature and I connect with people easily. I like meeting new people and exploring things . I am fond of travelling .
            <br>

            I like exploring new places and getting new experiences in life because I think that  life is all about adventures and getting new experiences . I also think that only work and study is not part of our lives so we should enjoy our life too.    
            <br> 
                
            I am always ready to help people around me. People should help each other instead of criticising and complaining. We should create a healthy and positive  environment wherever we go. According to me  One should enjoy his/her life in every possible way  .  Also  I am focused towards my goal and already I have started working on it and surely I will achieve it one day .</p>

            <p>I studied in a convent school . The name of my school was st. Joseph's convent school . It was situated in my hometown Khandwa only . I miss my school days a lot because those were the days I enjoyed my life at the fullest .

            <br>
            As I said, my school was a convent school. We had a great Christmas celebration every year . Childrens use to participate in various programs like dancing , singing , drama competition etc . On the day of Christmas we used to visit our school church to see the beautiful lighting and the religious programs .
                
            <br>
            My academic journey is so memorable . I belong to a commerce background . The names of my subject were:
                
            <br>

            <br>    
            Business studies 
            <br>    
            Economics 
            <br>    
                
            English 
            <br>     
                
            Hindi 
            <br>
            I remember one of my sir his name is Rajat singh . He was so supportive and had a very friendly behaviour with us . When I used to face any problems I directly go to that sir and he finds me a solution like a friend . After leaving the school also i am still in contact with him . Besides solving academic problems he also used to give us various life advices to become a successful person in our lives .
            <br>
                
            In school I was selected as the sports minister of my school . I used to teach basketball to the students and I prepared a basketball team for my school for the inter school Basketball competition and we won the competition . That day I was so happy . Also except basketball, I used to play volleyball .
            <br>    
                
            In the school days I had a group of 8 friends including me . We were the naughtiest in our school

            <br>
            Participating in extracurricular activities means getting involved in things outside of regular school lessons. It can be playing sports, joining clubs, or doing creative stuff like art and music. These activities help us learn new things, make friends, and have fun while growing as individuals.
                <br>


            Extra curricular activities  teach us important life skills like teamwork and time management, which are not just helpful for school but also for our future . participating in extra curricular activities is a smart way to learn and develop .
                <br>

            Extra curricular activities make school more enjoyable and help you grow as a person, preparing you for the future. One should always participate if he/she gets the opportunity.
